# Cao and Naranmoothy (2011) Replication

This repository contains the replication files for the study by Cao and Naranmoothy (2011). The goal is to replicate the results using the provided code and datasets.

## Repository Structure

- **code**: Contains all the `.do` files used for the replication. Each file is designed to run specific parts of the analysis.

  - `222.do`: Likely a script for data preprocessing or analysis.
  - `CN2011 Replication.do`: Main file for replicating the results from the Cao and Naranmoothy (2011) paper.
  - `Cao2011.do`: Additional script, possibly for secondary analysis or specific checks from the 2011 paper.

- **output**: Contains the results and documentation from the replication.

  - `Cao_Naranmoothy_Replication.docx`: The written documentation of the replication study, including methods, steps, and any discrepancies found during replication.
  - `Replication_Results.pdf`: The results of the replication in a concise, easy-to-read PDF format.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Ensure Stata is installed**: The `.do` files are Stata scripts and need Stata to run them.
2. **Run the code**: Open each `.do` file within Stata in the order listed in the `code/` folder.
3. **Examine outputs**: After running the scripts, review the results in the `output/` folder.
